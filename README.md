# KSP-Forum-Dark-Theme

After the KSP forum switch to the new IPS software, many people seemed to not like the all-white background, with ligh-grey text.

Forum user n.b.z was awesome enough to make a Dark Blue forum theme, useable with the Stylish addon.

I prefer REALLY dark, mostly black themes, and n.b.z was kind enough to give permission for me to tweak his theme.

This is my clumsy version of that theme.

A few relevant, very informative KSP Forum threads on changing/customizing your own themes, and how n.b.z wrote his Stylish theme, which can be "customized" by any one:
